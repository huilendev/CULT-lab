              CULT is where ideas evolve into digital rituals â€” a lab where code meets design, and precision becomes
              art. We are a New York-based creative collective blending the aesthetic of cyberpunk with the logic of
              engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              We represent rebellion, precision, and collaboration. Our team consists of creative developers and
              designers with strong technical expertise and an uncompromising vision for digital excellence. We don't
              follow trends; we create them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every project is a ritual. Every line of code is intentional. Every design decision is deliberate. We
              co-create with our clients to shape the future of the web, one digital experience at a time.
